# blog
react native blog app - used for practice
Users can make 'blogs' with a title and an entry. 
Users can then edit those notes blogs as they see fit and save their changes.
Changes are saved locally. 
All blogs and changes are saved locally.

This is very similar to a typical notes app. 
Made to practice navigation, reusable components, API calls/usage, and reusable context!
